# Project-ICC-Players

Weâ€™re going to create two functions in order to get most out of the ESPN ICC Data set :
Link to Kaggle Data set: https://www.kaggle.com/veeralakrishna/icc-test-cricket-runs

The Functions are:

1. ICC_Players :
This function, when entered even an incomplete name or a word or even a alphabet will return all the info and details of that player(s) .

2. Player_Image:
This function will take the index of the output from the ICC_Player function and will scrape the profile page of that player and return the url of the player image on his ESPN profile page which can be viewed by clicking on the link or using Image function
